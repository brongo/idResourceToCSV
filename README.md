# idResourceToCSV

A simple tool for converting DOOM Eternal .resource data into .csv format. 

Supports drag & drop usage for single resource files or main "Doom Eternal" directory. If used on the directory, will parse *all* resource files and remove any entries with duplicate names.

Note: currently does not respect packagemapspec.json load order.
